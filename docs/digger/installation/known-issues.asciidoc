== Known issues

=== HTTP proxy with macOS Jenkins node
When adding a macOS machine as a node/slave in Jenkins a direct connection is
required, meaning a HTTP proxy is not supported.

=== HTTP proxy authentication in Android builds
When building Android apps, the pod in which the apps are built cannot use a
proxy that requires authentication. This is due to a issue within Gradle.

=== Encrypted private key cannot be provided in Ansible provisioning
The user's private key can not be encrypted when running the Ansible playbook.

Note that this does not include the key pair that should be provided when
provisioning the macOS node, the private key of the macOS key pair should be
encrypted with a passphrase.

*Workaround*
You can use `openssl` to remove the passphrase from your key using the
following command.

----
openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/id_rsa -out ~/.ssh/id_rsa_new

=== Android SDK Manager tools don't support HTTP proxy with authentication
When installing the Android SDK into the SDK pod during provisioning, the
Android sdkmanager tools used doesn't support http proxy that requires
authentication.
