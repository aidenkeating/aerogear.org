== Monitor Digger
Nagios is provisioned by default in the Digger Ansible playbook. The Nagios
instance will perform a number of checks.

* Ensure the macOS machine is running and accessible
* Ensure the Jenkins instance is running
* Ensure the Android SDK pod is running.

The URL and credentials for the Nagios instance will be provided when the
Ansible job has completed provisioning it. When using the Ansible installer for
Digger Nagios is provisioned last, meaning that all checks should be passing
once the Nagios dashboard is available.
