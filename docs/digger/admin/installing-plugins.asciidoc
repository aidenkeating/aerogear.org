== Install Jenkins plugins
By default Digger will install a number of Jenkins plugins that are required
for it to perform as expected. If more plugins are required other than these
they can be specified using Ansible or using the Jenkins user interface.

NOTE: Plugins for Jenkins can be browsed at link::https://plugins.jenkins.io.

=== Using Ansible
The `jenkins_plugins` parameter can be overridden to include new plugins. The
structure of a Jenkins plugin is as follows.

[source,yaml]
----
-
  name: sample-plugin
  version: 1.20
  archive: http://updates.jenkins-ci.org/download/plugins/sample-plugin/1.20/sample-plugin.hpi
----

=== Using Jenkins UI
Go to `Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins`. If the plugin is not available in the
`Available` tab then it can be installed using a `.hpi` file in
`Advanced -> Upload Plugin`.
